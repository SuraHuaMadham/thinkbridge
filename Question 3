FEEDBACK

The website looks neat and clean. It has a lot of components that needed to be answered by the user. 
It will help user to fill the details online which will be convinent for them.

SUGGESTIONS

The UI  can be improved a little and the website takes a little bit more time than normal to load.
The view Signature here and view photo here functionality is not working correctly.
Other components of thr UI takes a lof of time to load which is making the website heavy.
Apart from that rest of it looks fine and good.
